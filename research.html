									<h2> Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies</h2>
									<p>Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) are a class of rapidly evolving, star forming galaxies. As their name implies, LCBGs are bright, blue in color, and compact. We see a lot of them very far away (and because the speed of light is constant, we know that when we see something far away, we are also seeing it at a much earlier time in the Universe), but not many in the nearby universe. This suggests that LCBGs are evolving into something else. But what could they be evolving into? </p>
									<p>A few theories for what they evolve into exist already. One theory suggests that LCBGs will eventually run out of fuel for star formation, stopr making new stars, and passively evolve until the massive blue stars have all died, and only the small red stars have survived. Another theory suggests that what we're seeing is actually the central bulge of a disk galaxy, and like the small elliptical galaxies, the bulge will stop forming new stars, and most of the star formation in the galaxy will happen in the disk. It has also been suggested that what we call LCBGs are actually a number of different galaxy types that will all eventually evolve into something unique. Whatever the case, it is our goal to determine what happens with these galaxies so that hopefully we can determine what has caused most galaxies in the universe in general to stop forming stars.</p>
									<p>How can we study these objects? I've worked in a number of collaborations aiming to answer some of the big questions about LCBG evolution. I'm looking at Neutral Hydrogen, a primordial fuel for star formation, in LCBGs to determine if these galaxies are running out of gas to form stars. I'm also working with a group to determine if LCBGs that are in a cluster of galaxies are different from LCBGs in the field. These investigations will mainly use optical and radio frequencies</p>

									<h2>Work on the International Celestial Reference Frame</h2>
									<p>The International Celestial Reference Frame is a grid of positions of radio loud quasars that covers the sky, determined using very long baseline interferometry. We use the known positions of these sources to point telescopes, determine positions on earth, and help with keeping time (ex. adding leap seconds to adjust for the rotation of earth) amongst other things. The sources are observed with radio telescopes all over the world and the data is combined to make a telescope the size of the Earth. This creates a telescope with amazing resolution,  </p>
									<p>In order for a sources position to be accurately known, we want the source to be as pointlike as possible. </p>
